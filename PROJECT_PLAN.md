# Project Plan Log

**Location:** `C:\Users\olade\OneDrive\WORK`
**Created:** February 16, 2026

## Vision & Priorities
- Portfolio site + Security Health Check as the immediate launch assets (Days 1–3 goal).
- Follow-up products in order: Templates, Small-business MVP, Retainers, Passive assets.
- Maintain a security-first mindset across every deliverable (defense-in-depth, input validation, hardened hosting, incident response readiness).

## Key Deliverables & Hosting Strategy
1. **Portfolio** – Static React/Vite or Tailwind site with demo projects, bio, CTA for free 10-minute scan, GitHub links. Deploy via GitHub → Vercel/Netlify.
2. **Security Health Check** – Node.js script (header checks, OWASP Top 10, HTTPS), combined with manual review. Deliver editable PDF report and run locally until serverless automation needed.
3. **Templates** – 3–5 reusable landing/multi-page kits delivered as zipped HTML/Tailwind. Demoed on Vercel/Netlify and sold through Gumroad or agency outreach.
4. **Small-business MVP** – Appointment/booking or simple e-commerce using Next.js + Supabase, notifications via SendGrid. Deploy front-end on Vercel, backend on Supabase.
5. **Retainers** – Security/maintenance packages (Basic/Pro/Emergency) documented with checklists and monthly health-check PDF.
6. **Passive products** – Checklist, mini-course, admin dashboard, or mini templates marketed via Gumroad/Envato after testimonials accumulate.

## Security Focus & Practices
- Assume adversaries of any skill level; implement defense-in-depth (CSP, HTTPS, input validation, authentication, least privilege).
- Keep secrets (API keys, env files) out of source control; enforce linting and dependency scans on each deploy.
- Automate monitoring; log anomalies and maintain a simple incident response workflow (detect-isolate-patch-communicate).
- Embed security assurances into deliverables (report sections, retainer documentation).

## Timeline & Milestones
- **Days 1–3:** Launch portfolio and Health Check sample PDF + script. Deploy portfolio to Vercel; document how to run scans.
- **Days 4–14:** Run 5 demo scans, produce reports, execute 10 outreach messages/day, craft template for sale.
- **Days 15–30:** Secure first paid client (Health Check or simple landing), deliver work, collect testimonials, begin selling templates and retainer offers.
- **Days 31–60:** Add retainer clients, build small MVP, explore recurring revenue upsells.
- **Days 61–90:** Expand with larger projects, raise prices based on testimonials, develop passive content.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Finalize portfolio copy/structure and deploy.
2. Build the Health Check automation + PDF deliverable; document operations.
3. Draft 10 tailored outreach messages referencing Columbus (remote/local) and the free scan offer.
4. Keep security guarantees visible on portfolio/Health Check documentation.

## Notes
- Payment/hosting considerations: use Vercel/Netlify/Supabase free tiers; parent handles payments if needed until 18.
- Record outreach, scan results, testimonials for future marketing.
