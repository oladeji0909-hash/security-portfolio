# Outreach Messages (Columbus + Remote Friendly)

Each message references the live portfolio, the free 10-minute scan, and the Security Health Check report. Swap placeholders for industry/business names as needed.

1. **Email - Local freelance intro**  
Hi [Name], I’m Oladeji, a Columbus-based student web dev/security specialist. My new portfolio + Security Health Check is live at `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`, and I’d love to run a free 10-minute scan on [Business]. No obligation—just a short report with 1–2 fixes. Can I scan your site this week?

2. **DM - Local service business**  
Hey [Name], saw [Business] still loads over HTTPS but lacks a few headers that stop clickjacking/phishing. I’d be happy to deliver a fast “Health Check” PDF within 24h—free for the first 10 minutes of scanning. Want me to send over the findings?

3. **Email - Remote friendly**  
Hello [Name], I help small teams ship secure landing pages quickly. My portfolio + Security Health Check is live at `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`. Can I offer you a free scan of your site and walk through one prioritized fix?

4. **LinkedIn - Local founder**  
Hi [Name], I’m Oladeji—student developer + hardening specialist. I’m running a few free scans for Columbus founders this week to demonstrate the Security Health Check featured on `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`. Quick 10-minute review, PDF report, and a suggested fix. Interested?

5. **Discord - Tech community**  
Hi [Name], checking in from the Columbus dev scene—if you’ve got a site to protect, I can run a free 10-minute scan (using the Health Check toolkit I built) and share a one-page report linked to `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`. Replies within 24 hrs.

6. **Email - Nonprofit**  
Hey [Name], nonprofit sites are frequent targets. I’d love to send you a short report outlining HTTPS, CSP, HSTS, and permissions gaps (it’s part of the Security Health Check I demonstrate at `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`). It takes 10 minutes for me, and I can share the PDF right after.

7. **Email - Restaurant/local shop**  
Hello [Name], I’m offering local businesses a complimentary security snapshot with a clear fix list. I’ll use the same Health Check reports shown on `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app` so you know exactly what you’re getting. Want to book a 10-minute scan slot?

8. **SMS/WhatsApp - Quick ask**  
Hey [Name], Oladeji here (Columbus developer). Just launched a Security Health Check package—10-minute scan, editable PDF report (see the proof-of-work at `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`). Drop me your URL and I’ll post the findings right back. No charge.

9. **Follow-up Email**  
Hi [Name], I ran the free scan and spotted a few header gaps. I can send you the Security Health Check report + remediation quote (or handle it as part of a retainer). Want to review together?

10. **LinkedIn - Remote agency/outreach**  
Hi [Name], I help agencies deliver hardened templates + Health Checks (portfolio link: `https://security-portfolio-kappa.vercel.app`). If you’re taking on new clients, I can supply a ready-to-roll scan report that fits inside your deliverables. Can we chat for 10 minutes?
